Please note the following when making changes to the DataContext Project:

1. If you need to add an new table, you can do the following:
	- Add a class in the Core --> Domain file with the name of your table and add all your columns.
	- The final step is to go and add your DbSet<ClassName> to the OEDataContext.cs which can be found in the Core Folder. You ONLY need to do this if you need to reference the table by using (var context = new OEDataContext()) --> context.TableName.

2. If you need to add a new SQL View or Stored Procedure, PLEASE follow the next steps:
	- Add a new Migration and add your query withing the SQL() method.
